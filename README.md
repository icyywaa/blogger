This short project is a webpage, mostly the frontend, where anyone in the world could add, read or save blogposts.
Somewhere safe to share your mind without being judged and just be who you are!
This project is built from React.js and TailwindCSS, it follows reacts file structure and some good practices aswell.

My src contains two extra files, assets and components: assets is a file with all the pictures and icons used in this project.

Components holds all the different components that. where created, 

Navbar that follows you wherever you go for easy acces back to Home.

Home that is the initial route where the welcome is, giving you a short insight on what the page is about. Home also contains other componets within as imports which are external componets, sucha as ImageOne, ImageTwo, ImageThree, TextBox and TextBox2.
The images files uses the react-parallax library added from npm for the popouler parallax feauter. The Textbox files have simple text to make the welcome page look more alive and welcoming.

Blog is where the default categoriy of ¨AI Generated¨ is, which has more subcategories for the user to choose from and read, the webpage is not done but this is a template and has great potential for me as the creater to upgrade in the future when i have more knowledge.

I did consider finishing the entire project complete with a backend and more features, but i took the callenge to lighly and undearestimated the work that had to be done, i did not finish because it would take too long and i simply dont have the time right now. In the future i can see this becoming something big and when time comes i will finish it.

I created something that i feel is very interessting and and could be helpful for people with a big imagination and generally some people who wants to share their minds with people ar outside your circle and just have your thought heard... in the art of a story, as a book! :)
