### Description: Blogger by Elisha Nazar

This short project is a website, primarily the frontend, where anyone in the world can add, read, or save blog posts. Somewhere safe to express yourself without fear of being judged and to simply be yourself! This website has no form of commenting or likingÂ functionality. This is a frontend template for an open log. This project is built with React.js and TailwindCSS, and it adheres to the react file structure as well as some best practices.

My src folder contains two additional files: assets and components. assets is a file that contains all of the images and icons used in this project.
Components contains all of the various components that were created.
Navbar that follows you around for easy access to Home, or Blog.
Home is the initial route where the welcome appears, giving you a brief overview of what the page is about. Home also contains imports that are external components, such as ImageOne, ImageTwo, ImageThree, TextBox, and TextBox2. 
For the popular parallax feature, the images files make use of the react-parallax library from npm. Simple text is used in the Text box files to make the welcome page appear more alive and welcoming. 

When you first visit the page, you are greeted with a beautiful user interface that includes the parallax effect, and three different images that depict what this site is about. Each image has a short sentence that explains what you should do here. Welcome to Blogger! Share Your Mind!, Make It Count! It is about sharing your thoughts and making them count. Writing has died out over the years, but Blogger could become a place where you can share your wildest imaginations in the form of a book or simply a post about your thoughts.

As you scroll the Home page the pictures transition from one to the other with a separating paragraph following the default theme and category of the website, 'AI Generated'. Where the short stories are generated from the world famous AI chat, ChatGPT. (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)
On the top of the page, there is a navbar with the page name and the logo, which is an open book with blank pages. All you have to do to start writing is to depict that the world is your canvas. In the upper right corner, we can see our two pages: Home, where we are right now, and Blog. The blog is where the action is. You can return home at any time by clicking Home or the logo; the navbar is always with you.

The blog has a default category of AI Generated for now, which has more subcategories for the user to choose from and read, the webpage is not finished but this is a template and has great potential for me as the creator to upgrade in the future when I have more knowledge.
I considered finishing the entire project, complete with a backend and additional features, but I took the challenge too lightly and underestimated the amount of work that needed to be done; I did not finish because it would take too long, and I simply do not have the time right now. 
I see this growing into something significant in the future, and when the time comes, I will complete it.

I created something that I think is very interesting and could be useful for people with a lot of imaginations and generally others who want to share their minds with people outside their circle and just have their thoughts heard... in the form of a story, as a book!:)
