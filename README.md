This short project is a website, primarily the frontend, where anyone in the world can add, read, or save blog posts. Somewhere safe to express yourself without fear of being judged and to simply be yourself! This project is built with React.js and TailwindCSS, and it adheres to the react file structure as well as some best practices.

My src folder contains two additional files: assets and components. assets is a file that contains all of the images and icons used in this project.

Components contains all of the various components that were created.

Navbar that follows you around for easy access to Home, or Blog.

Home is the initial route where the welcome appears, giving you a brief overview of what the page is about. Home also contains imports that are external components, such as ImageOne, ImageTwo, ImageThree, TextBox, and TextBox2.
For the popular parallax feature, the images files make use of the react-parallax library from npm. Simple text is used in the Text box files to make the welcome page appear more alive and welcoming.

The default category of AI Generated that is in  blog for now, which has more subcategories for the user to choose from and read, the webpage is not finished but this is a template and has great potential for me as the creator to upgrade in the future when I have more knowledge.

I considered finishing the entire project, complete with a backend and additional features, but I took the challenge too lightly and underestimated the amount of work that needed to be done; I did not finish because it would take too long, and I simply do not have the time right now. I see this growing into something significant in the future, and when the time comes, I will complete it.

I created something that I think is very interesting and could be useful for people with a lot of imaginations and generally some people who want to share their minds with people outside their circle and just have their thoughts heard... in the form of a story, as a book!:)
