        A mysterious story -Chatgpt
      </h3>
      <p>
        As the night fell, the moon cast an eerie glow upon the abandoned
        mansion. The wind howled through the broken windows, rustling the
        tattered curtains and stirring up dust that had long settled on the
        floor. It was said that the mansion was cursed, haunted by the ghosts of
        its former inhabitants who had met a tragic end. Many had tried to
        unravel the secrets of the mansion, but none had succeeded. Some claimed
        to have heard faint whispers in the darkness, while others reported
        seeing shadowy figures lurking in the corners of their eyes. But no one
        dared to enter the mansion alone, for fear of never returning. As the
        years passed, the mansion remained a mystery, a dark and foreboding
        presence that loomed over the small town below. Some said that the
        mansion was a portal to another world, while others believed that it
        held the key to unlocking unimaginable power. Whatever the truth may be,
        the mansion remained a tantalizing enigma, drawing in curious
        adventurers and thrill-seekers from all corners of the world. And as
        long as it stood, the mysteries of the mansion would continue to haunt
        the minds of those who dared to venture near.
